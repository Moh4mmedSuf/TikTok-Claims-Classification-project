# TikTok-Claims-Classification-project
Data analysis + Machine Learning Model 

- Project Background: 
TikTok support Teams are trying to mitigate misinformation in videos on the platform and while doing They faced an issue where there were Too many Reported Videos For our Employees To handle Manually.

- The Project Purpose: 
solving the issue by Building a Machine Learning Model that Reduces the number of manual reviews.

- The Machine Learning Model goal:
After Analyzing the Data, we concluded that it's much more likely that a reported video is presenting a Claim rather than an opinion so it will get prioritized to get individually reviewed by a human moderator.
The goal of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or an "opinion" to help with the process of verifying if an account has violated the terms of service.

- Steps:
  
1\ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization 
2\ Hypothesis Testing â€“ Confirming that there's a statistically significant difference in the average view count of Verified and unverified accounts.
3\ Logistic Regression Model
4\ Machine Learning Model (Random Forest & XGBoost)
5\ Evaluating & testing

- Results:
A supervised Machine Learning Model (Random Forest) That performed near perfect with an F1 Score of 99% and a precision score of 99%, That predicted whether The video presented either A claim or an Opinion Based on the Engagement levels associated with each video, including views, likes, shares, and downloads.
